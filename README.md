# Masterprojekt - PWA, Service Worker and more

This is part of an elaboration about Progressive Web App, Service Worker and more.

## Requirements

Because Service Worker won't work over _file://_ you need to run a local server.
Use for example:
* NPM http-server - https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server
* Chrome Webserver
* MAMP/XAMP

## How to

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Set up local server
3. Serve and open folder in browser (Google Chrome)
4. Open DevTools and navigate to _Application_ Panel
5. Inspect Service Worker, Manifest, Cache and more
